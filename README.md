CREWS is needed as we use its spongeABC function.

Run figure1a.m,figure1b.m,figure1c.m, figure1d.m 

Run figure2Stability.m, then run figure2PlotStability.m

Then run AnalyticResult.ipynb to get the analytical solution and the seismic ricker source,
which is obtained from Devito.

Then run figure3a.m to get the I-SGFD seismogram.
Then run figure3b.m to get the HEI-SGFD seismogram.
Then run figure3c.m to get the comparison plots. 
Then run figure3d.m to get the comparison plots. 


Then run figure5aSaltTraScheme.m to get the I-SGFD scheme seismic records,
and run figure5bsaltCoeffNewScheme.m to get the HEI-SGFD scheme seismic records.
Then run figure5c.m and figure5d.m to get the comparsion of the seismic records.
